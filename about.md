# About

Professionally, I work as an SRE focusing on Kubernetes infrastructure, service mesh technologies like Istio and Envoy Proxy, and building controllers and operators in Go.

In my free time, I work on systems programming, particularly networking tools and kernel interfaces. I write code that deals with packet capture, process identification, and cross-platform compatibility between macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Professional Work

- Site Reliability Engineering with Kubernetes
- Service mesh technologies (Istio, Envoy Proxy)
- Kubernetes controllers and operators
- Go development

## What I Work On In My Free Time

- Networking tools and kernel interfaces like eBPF
- Performance optimization
- Network analysis and deep packet inspection

## Current Projects

- **[RustNet](https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet)**: A network monitoring tool with experimental eBPF support
- **[FFmpeg Exporter](https://github.com/domcyrus/ffmpeg_exporter)**: A Prometheus exporter using FFprobe to expose metrics about media streams (SRT, HLS, RTMP, RTSP)
- Various contributions to networking and systems tools

## Interests

- eBPF programming and kernel tracing
- Differences between macOS PKTAP and Linux networking APIs
- Rust for systems programming
- Real-time packet processing
- Cross-platform compatibility
