# About Marco

I'm a systems programmer with a passion for high-performance networking and kernel development. My journey spans from StarCraft strategy (where "domcyrus" originated) to building production systems that handle real-time network traffic.

## What I Do

I specialize in:

- **Systems Programming**: Building low-level networking tools and kernel interfaces
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Bridging differences between macOS, Linux, and Windows APIs
- **Performance Engineering**: Optimizing critical paths and reducing latency
- **Network Analysis**: Deep packet inspection and protocol reverse engineering

## Current Projects

- **[RustNet](https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet)**: A high-performance network monitoring terminal UI tool with experimental eBPF support
- Various open-source contributions to networking and systems tools

## Technical Interests

- eBPF programming and kernel tracing
- macOS PKTAP vs Linux networking APIs
- Rust for systems programming
- Real-time packet processing and analysis
- Cross-platform compatibility challenges

## Get in Touch

*Fun fact: The "domcyrus" handle dates back to my StarCraft days. I've kept it as a reminder that strategic thinking applies to both gaming and software architecture!*
