# Welcome to Marco's Tech Blog

Hi! I'm Marco, a systems programmer passionate about high-performance networking, kernel development, and cross-platform software engineering.

Here you'll find technical deep-dives into:

- **Systems Programming**: eBPF, kernel interfaces, and low-level optimization
- **Network Monitoring**: Packet capture, DPI, and real-time analysis
- **Cross-Platform Development**: macOS vs Linux kernel APIs and design patterns
- **Performance Engineering**: Profiling, optimization, and architectural decisions

I'm the creator of [RustNet](https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet), a high-performance network monitoring tool written in Rust.
