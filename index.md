# Welcome to domcyrus.dev

Hi! I'm Marco, an SRE working with Kubernetes, service mesh, and Go. In my free time, I work on systems programming projects involving networking tools and kernel interfaces.

Here you'll find technical articles about:

- **Systems Programming**: eBPF, kernel interfaces, and networking tools
- **SRE & Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, service mesh, observability
- **Cross-Platform Development**: macOS vs Linux kernel APIs and design patterns
- **Network Analysis**: Packet capture, DPI, and protocol analysis

Current projects include [RustNet](https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet), a network monitoring tool with eBPF support, and [FFmpeg Exporter](https://github.com/domcyrus/ffmpeg_exporter), a Prometheus exporter for media stream metrics.
